# Raspberrypi Setup

This note contains the steps I used for configuring the raspberry pi computers for the network for this work.  It is general, but was done for this work.

##  Computer Used
This project used Raspberrypi 3 B+ computers.

##  Additional Purchases

### Power Connector
You need to power the computers.  For this the standard connection is a usb-mini.  I tried some older usb-mini connections around
my house, but they didn't work.  I ended up buying three different ones.  The one I like best is 
_"Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ Plus Power Supply 5V 3A with Switch UL Certified Compatible w/ 2.5A 2A 1.5A 1A Fast Rapid Charge AC Adapter w/ 1.5m Extra Long On Off Power Switch Micro USB Cable"_.
It seems sturdy and it has an on/off switch.  This is nice for powering off the computer a few times.

### Micro SD Card
I ended up buying 128 Sandisk cards.  Just follow the instructions at [SD Formatting](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sdxc_formatting.md)
